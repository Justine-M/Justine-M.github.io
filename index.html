            <p>
                I was born in Philadelphia, PA and I attended the Philadelphia High School for Girls and later
                graduated from Stony Brook
                University AKA as SUNY Stony Brook with a B.S. degree in Chemistry. Some of my interests include
                watching movies
                and different television shows. My favourtie movie is Rebecca, although ironically I have not read the
                book yet.
                I am not going to lie I watch alot of shows and I cannot keep them all straight. Superman is my
                favourite superhero
                and my second is Black Panther since I love cats, especially black cats. I've always wanted a black
                cat. Speaking
                of cats I have one named Barry Allen and he is satirically almost completely white. As an avid food
                lover I love
                trying out different foods from different cultures.

                <p>
                    Right now I am trying to be the best person I can be. People think I have a bubbly personality, but
                    sometimes I can be a
                    bit judgemental. I've been to southern California once and since then I've wanted to move there.
                    The weather
                    there is amazing and I've always wanted to move someplace that has beaches. I love to read blogs
                    just to
                    read peoples different perspectives on multiple issues. Somethings involve seeing the whole
                    picture. I've
                    always wanted to learn coding and programming. I think it is such an interesting tool to learn
                    especially
                    now when eveything we do is digitized and computerized. It almost feels like a necessity now and
                    days.
